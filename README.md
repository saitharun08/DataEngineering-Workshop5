#### Things to Note:

2. If the working project is not ready you may copy the project myworld from the DataEngineering-Workshop4 repository which you have cloned for the previous workshop
and paste it in the current directory which you are going to work on for this workshop.
   
3. You will have to clone DataEngineering-Workshop5 repository for today's workshop. But make sure to create a new folder outside that repository and work on it instead of 
making all the changes to DataEngineering-Workshop5 directly.
